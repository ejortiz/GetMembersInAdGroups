Hello! This is a simple script used to pull users from ADGroups.

At the top, there is an example on how to retrieve members from AD 
Groups that match a group name pattern. For example, "test" would match 
AD groups:
"test"
"testingGroup"
"testForExample"
Etc.

By default, the script will output a csv file to the user's desktop, but 
feel free to modify in any way.
